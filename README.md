Insights:
About this project
- Analysing the data of MGH for a subset of patients, records of their visits and the procedures undertaken during the years of 2011-2022. We analyse the group of patients based on gender and age group, about how much do they spend on an average for their hospital visits and the duration of it. The focus is also on the insurance payers, how many of the people have an insurance and the top players in the insurance payers. The most common types of visits among the patients and most common type of procedures undergone by the patients and what age group is prone to it.

- The KPIs of the dashboard:

1. Number of patients : We are analysing the data over 974 distinct number of patients.
2. Total Cost Over the Patients: The hospital over the years has charged 110 M $, out which a certain part is paid by the insurance cover.
3. Total Payer Cost: The overall payer insurance amount combined across all the payers across the patients is 31M $.
4. Average Cost per visit: On an average whenever a person visits the hospital (which is the encounter in this case) , they tend to spend 3.6k $, out of which some maybe covered by the insurance payer.
5. Average time spent during a Visit: The visit may contain the procedures performed and therefore the time may vary, on an average it is 7.2 hours.
6. Readmission Rate: The re-admission rate of patients is 87%.

Patients: We see that the females have a slightly higher ratio as compared to the men and the age group most prone to the visits is 80+.

Encounters: Encounter types by percent, the most common encounter type is ambulatory. On an average the hospital charges 3.6k $ to a patient, out which 1.1k $ is covered by insurance (average amount).

Procedures: Not all procedures are covered under the insurance payers, only about 30% is covered under insurance. The top 5 payers are Dual Eligible, Anthem , UnitedHealthCare, Aetna , Blue Cross Shield.
